## Slack Notify ##

This provides functionality to insert messages into channels, private groups, or private message (via slackbot) from a c# application.

Include the SlackNotify project in your solution, and reference the 'SlackNotify' namespace.

The SlackNotifyConsole project is just a smal console app for testing the functionality of the class library.
